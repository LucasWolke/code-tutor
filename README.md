# Code Tutor ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Code Tutor is a web-based IDE that **hopefully** uses open-source LLMs to help students learn how to code in Java.

## Features (WIP)

- Monaco-powered IDE in the browser
- Containerized backend with an open-source LLM (like LLaMA or Mistral)
- Safe and isolated Java code execution with real-time output
- AI-powered code explanation and tutoring

## Tech Stack (WIP)

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Flask Python or Java Spring Boot, Docker
- **LLM**: Open-source language model (self-hosted)
- **Code Execution**: Java code sandboxing in Docker

## Getting Started

1. Wait for me to implement app...
2. Profit?
